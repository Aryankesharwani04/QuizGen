728950,Coding & Interview Prep,System Design,Hard,1200,"A client sends an HTTP request to a load balancer, which routes it to one of the multiple web servers. What is the primary benefit of using a load balancer in this scenario?",Improved security by hiding IP addresses of web servers behind the load balancer,Reduced latency by caching frequently accessed resources,Increased scalability and availability by distributing incoming traffic across multiple web servers,Enhanced performance by compressing data packets before forwarding them to web servers,OptionC
728950,Coding & Interview Prep,System Design,Hard,1200,"In a distributed database system, what is the main reason for using a consensus protocol like Raft or Paxos?",To ensure that all nodes in the system have the same clock time,To prevent split-brain scenarios by achieving agreement on a single value,To reduce latency by caching frequently accessed data,To increase security by encrypting data in transit,OptionB
728950,Coding & Interview Prep,System Design,Hard,1200,"A system consists of a single point of failure, which can bring down the entire system if it fails.

728950,Coding & Interview Prep,System Design,Hard,1200,A system uses a caching layer to improve performance by reducing the number of requests to the underlying database. Which of the following cache invalidation strategies is most suitable for a read-heavy workload?,Cache invalidation based on a TTL (time-to-live) timer,Cache invalidation based on a TTL timer with a low TTL value,Cache invalidation based on a percentage of cache hits,On-write cache invalidation,OptionB
728950,Coding & Interview Prep,System Design,Hard,1200,"In a system with a high volume of incoming requests, what is the primary benefit of using a message queue like Apache Kafka?",Improved performance by executing requests in parallel,Increased reliability by automatically retrying failed requests,Decoupling of producers and consumers to handle large volumes of requests,Reduced latency by caching frequently accessed resources,OptionC
